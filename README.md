# PHilita Legacy Simulation
## _Prototype London Sim 2019/20 repository_
---
This repository holds the codebase the prototype simulation of London run for the Thales Tech challenge, and all associated files:
- OTP build and source
- Source files 
- File structure
- Python wrapper
- O.D. Generator

This is stored for posterity and shouldn't really be worked on - it was super botched together. 
The ATOC and LDN GTFS files have been removed since they are over 100MB. You can obtain them from:
